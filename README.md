# Quarto Data Analysis Samples (R)

This repository contains two Quarto documents demonstrating my data wrangling, text processing, and visualization skills in R using **tidyverse** and other related packages. These examples were originally completed as part of *ESM 244: Advanced Data Analysis* and are intended to show my familiarity with Quarto workflows and reproducible data analysis.

## Contents

### 1. ramnath_qual_text_analysis.qmd
**Output:** `ramnath_qual_text_analysis.html`  

This notebook illustrates qualitative text wrangling and exploratory analysis using:

- `tidyverse`  
- `tidytext`  
- `pdftools`  
- `ggwordcloud`  
- `textdata`  

It includes text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word filtering, term frequency summaries, and visualizations. The .qmd includes the complete methods and code used for this assignment  

The HTML file is included because it renders cleanly and is small enough for GitHub.

### 2. ramnath_time_series_obs.qmd
**Output:** `ramnath_time_series_obs.pdf`  

This notebook demonstrates a workflow for time series data using:

- `tidyverse`  
- `tsibble`  
- `feasts`  
- `lubridate`  
- `ggplot2`  
- `patchwork`  
- `paletteer`  
- `here`  

It includes data wrangling, converting to tsibble formats, time series interpretations, and visualization. 

The original HTML output exceeded GitHub’s size limit due to figure resolution, so a **PDF** version is included instead. The .qmd includes the complete methods and code used for this assignment.

## Skills Demonstrated

These samples highlight:

- Proficiency with **tidyverse** for wrangling and cleaning data  
- Experience with **text processing** and **time series analysis**  
- Use of **ggplot2**, `patchwork`, and `paletteer` for visualization  
- Ability to write clear, reproducible **Quarto** reports with methods and interpretation  
- Organized workflow and documented code

## Reproducibility Notes

## Data

The `.qmd` files reference course datasets stored locally during assignments. For viewing purposes, the rendered `.html` and `.pdf` files show the full workflow, figures, and outputs. The raw data is not included in this repository.

- No external folders or additional files are required.
